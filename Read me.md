## My process

Hereâ€™s a shorter version of your process description:

### Project Overview
#### HTML Structure
- `Setup`: Started with basic HTML5 structure, including DOCTYPE, lang attribute, and meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings.
- `Resources`: Linked to external stylesheet (style.css), favicon, and Google Fonts for custom typography.
- `Content`: Wrapped main content in a div with the class container, added profile picture, headings for name and location, a brief bio, and a list of social media links.
#### CSS Styling
-` Reset and Variables`: Used a universal selector to reset margins and padding, defined CSS variables for colors.
-` Layout`: Centered content using Flexbox, applied background color to body, styled container with padding, background color, and rounded corners.
- `Typography`: Used "Inter" font from Google Fonts, styled headings and paragraphs for a clear visual hierarchy.
- `Elements`: Styled profile image to be circular, added spacing, styled list items with background color, padding, rounded corners, and hover effect.
- `Attribution`: Added a small section at the bottom with links to the challenge and my profile.
#### Key Learnings
- `Flexbox`: Centering content using Flexbox.
- `Responsive Design`: Ensuring the page looks good on various devices.
- `CSS Variables`: Using CSS variables for easier maintenance.
